Repo to store all source code for my Scala project


## Why learn Scala? 

- Cutting edge research language, used very widely in the academic fields. 
- Accepted in the industry
- Runs on all major platforms: JSM, JS, Native (thus on iOS), Android and GraaIVM, Scala also have support for React.js, check out Scala-js.org. 
- General purpose programming language, which can build microservices applications all the way to simple CLI application.  
- Pure OO language that heavily encourages function programming 
- Great market position: backend, data mining, machine learning, ai and more. 
- More popular than Haskel, and thus it has higher demand for developers in the industry. 
- Concise syntax (up to 10x reduction of LOC)
- Extremely powerful type system
- Statisically typed with local type inference


## Why learn Scala now? 

- Cutting edge theoretical foundation for scala's types: Dependent Object Types
- Brand new compiler (used to be scalac)
- More beginner friendly
- Lots of new features, existing ones are simplified 
- Dropped unncessary/complicated features 
- Even more concise syntax 
- More opinionated 
- More type safety at compile time 
- Better type inference
- Better compatibilty across versions
- Less bugs both in your code and in the compiler  
- Better tooling 

## What is Scala? 

Scala => Scalable Language

- 100% Pure Expression Oriented Language
	+ Example of an expression: print("Hello World!")  
	+ Everything is an expression
	+ Every expression computes to a value 
	+ Every value has a type 
	+ Every value is an object even functions
	+ Less uncessary curly braces {} (especially in Scala 3), less parenthesis 
	+ Every expression should produce a value in theory, but in practice an infinite loop for example never finishes and thus never produces a value. 
	+ Every value, expression, statement in Scala is an object, so that means we can call a function on all variable

- Scalable language: 
	+ regular
	+ concise
	+ powerful, not "just" pretty.
